She is currently the Los Angeles Bureau Chief for KQED public radio, where she uncovers the wide array of people, places and events that make Southern California such a fascinating region or, in the words of Wernor Herzog, &#8220;a place of cultural substance.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Clark has spent more than a decade covering public affairs, politics, the economy and the environment for national public radio outlets including <em>APM</em>, <em>NPR</em>, and the <em>BBC</em>.  She is a frequent contributor to the business show <em>Marketplace</em>, where she covered the gulf oil spill and its economic implications.  She is also a former staff reporter and editor for the weekly syndicated show <em>Weekend America.</em></p>\n\n\n\t<p>In 2009 Clark received a Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford to explore the geospatial web and its applications for innovating journalism, working with the Stanford Computer Science Department, the Bill Lane Center for the Study of the American West, and the Hasso Platner Institute of Design, or d.school.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>&#8220;Foreclosure City,&#8221; Clark&#8217;s documentary on the epicenter of the nation&#8217;s foreclosure crisis, Las Vegas, made her a finalist for the Livingston Award for Journalists under 35, one of journalism&#8217;s highest honors. Earlier in her career she spent several years in a small town in Colorado where she reported on the rural American West for the environmental newspaper High Country News.  There, her documentary on the legacy of nuclear weapons development in western states was awarded Best Documentary by the Public Radio News Directors Inc.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Clark graduated cum laude with honors from Yale University, where she earned a B.A. in The Humanities. She is a frequent speaker on journalism and the geospatial web at institutions including Google, Stanford&#8217;s Human Computer Interaction Group, and the American Association of University Women.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>As a fifth generation Californian, Clark is keenly interested in history and the way people shape places, and places shape people.  Her audio installation, <em>Block of Time: O&#8217;Farrell Street</em>, was featured alongside MIT&#8217;s <em>SENSEable Cities</em> project and Stamen Design&#8217;s <em>TenderVoice/TenderNoise</em> at the City Centered Festival in San Francisco, sponsored by the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts.

                    "bio": "<p>Vinod grew up dreaming of being an entrepreneur, despite growing up in an Indian Army household with no business or technology connections. Since the age of 16, when he first heard about Intel starting up, he dreamt of starting his own technology company.\nUpon graduating with a bachelor&#8217;s in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Vinod failed, at age 20, to start a soy milk company to service the many people in India who did not have refrigerators. He came instead to the U.S. and got his master&#8217;s in biomedical engineering at Carnegie-Mellon University. His start-up dreams attracted him to Silicon Valley, where he got an MBA at Stanford University in 1980.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Upon graduation he was one of the three founders of Daisy Systems, which was the first significant computer-aided design system for electrical engineers. The company went on to achieve significant revenue, profits, and an IPO, but Khosla, driven by the frustration of having to design the computer hardware on which the Daisy software needed to be built, started the standards-based Sun Microsystems in 1982 to build workstations for software developers. At Sun he pioneered &#8220;open systems&#8221; and RISC processors. Sun was funded by longtime friend and board member John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &#38; Byers.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In 1986 Vinod switched sides and joined Kleiner Perkins, where he was and continues to be a general partner of KPCB funds through KP X. Through the years there, with other partners, he took on Intel&#8217;s monopoly with Nexgen/AMD (the only microprocessor to have significant success against Intel, sold to AMD for 28 percent of AMD), incubated the idea and business plan for Juniper to take on Cisco&#8217;s dominance of the router market, formulated the very early advertising-based search strategy for Excite, and transformed the moribund telecommunications business and its archaic SONET implementations with Cerent (sold to Cisco for $7B). He helped in creating value, having fun, succeeding, failing (remember Dynabook?), and driving impact in partnership with entrepreneurs and the partners at KPCB.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In 2004, Vinod, driven by the need for flexibility to accommodate four teenaged children and a desire to be more experimental, to fund sometimes imprudent &#8220;science experiments,&#8221; and to take on both for-profit and for &#8220;social impact&#8221; ventures, formed khoslaventures, funded entirely with family funds. His goals remain the same: work and learn from fun and knowledgeable entrepreneurs, build impactful companies through the leverage of innovation, and spend time in a partnership that makes a difference. Vinod has a passion for nascent technologies that can have a beneficial effect and economic impact on society. His greatest passion is being a mentor to entrepreneurs, helping them build technology-based businesses. Vinod serves on the boards of a few companies, but he generally meets directly with most of the portfolio companies as they face transitions or key decisions.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Khosla is a charter member of TiE, a not-for-profit global network of entrepreneurs and professionals founded in 1992 that now has more than forty chapters in nine countries. He is also a founding board member of the Indian School of Business. His current passion is social entrepreneurship, with a special emphasis on microfinance as a poverty alleviation tool. He is a supporter of many microfinance organizations in India and Africa. He has been experimenting with education and global housing. Vinod is also passionate about alternative energy, petroleum independence, and the environment.</p>",

Launched publicly in 2010, Startl is a social enterprise dedicated to accelerating digital products for learning – from kindergarten to college, inside and outside the classroom. Startl recruits innovators and entrepreneurs, immerses them in rigorous product design and business development processes, and helps them build socially responsible and fiscally sustainable start-ups that will change the future of learning. In this way, Startl seeks to do for the nascent digital media and learning market what the Sundance Institute has done for the independent film community: support promising talent, stimulate alternative products, and open new distribution channels.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>At the same time, Diana is also leading a host of New York City institutions—including the New York Public Library, American Museum of Natural History, Museum for African Art, Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum, Wildlife Conservation Society—through an adaptive design and experimental change process. The goal of this <a href=\"http://www.newyouthcity.org\">New Youth City Learning Network</a> project is to create new partnerships and pathways that help young people connect different learning opportunities through online tools and offline experiences.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In 2004, Diana established the Knowledge Institutions program at the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) to support the transformation of organizations focused on knowledge production and dissemination. Current projects look at the mounting challenges to public higher education, new models for scientific innovation and collaboration, and the social and technical factors that drive individual and collective creativity. While in her role at the SSRC, Diana also served a two-year appointment to the National Science Foundation, where she was the founding program director of the Virtual Organizations and the Cyberlearning programs.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Over the course of her career, Diana has worked with various clients on the design of new organizational strategies and structures for innovation, ranging from large-scale international agencies and national research centers to medium-scale technology corporations and small-scale not-for-profit entities. She has also published in numerous academic journals, including Science, Nature, Minerva, Thesis Eleven, and The Annual Review of Law and Social Science. Her recently completed volume entitled Knowledge Matters: The Public Mission of the University will be available in December 2010. For both her practical applications and theoretical contributions in this area, Diana was named a Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer (2005-2007), an award that honors individuals at the leading edge of science.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Prior to coming to New York, Diana was the co-founder and research director of the Hybrid Vigor Institute in San Francisco, an assistant professor at Stanford University School of Education, a Fulbright fellow in Argentina, and a policy analyst and advisor for former Massachusetts Governor William Weld. She has a Ph.D. in international development and education and an M.A. in sociology from Stanford University, as well as an M.Ed. from Harvard University and a B.A. from Brown University.</p>",

He founded the company in 1999 with a vision to create an on-demand information management service that would replace traditional enterprise software technology. Benioff is regarded as the leader of what he has termed &#8220;The End of Software,&#8221; the now-proven belief that multi-tenant, on-demand applications democratize information by delivering immediate benefits at reduced risks and costs.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Under Benioff&#8217;s direction, salesforce.com has grown from a groundbreaking idea into a publicly traded company that is the market and technology leader in on-demand business services. For its revolutionary approach, salesforce.com has been lauded as one of BusinessWeek’s Top 100 Most Innovative Companies, named No. 7 on The Wired 40, and selected for the past two years as a Top Ten Disrupter by Forbes. The product has won the Software &#38; Information Industry Association Codie Award for Best CRM for the past six years, and the Codie Award for Best On-Demand Platform in 2007, as well as multiple “Editor’s Choice” designations from PC Magazine. Benioff has been widely recognized for pioneering innovation with honors such as the 2007 Ernst &#38; Young Entrepreneur of the Year, the SDForum Visionary Award, Alumni Entrepreneur of the Year by the University of Southern California (USC) Marshall School of Business, and being ranked No. 7 on the Top 100 Most Influential People in IT survey by eWEEK. He was appointed by President George W. Bush as the co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee and served from 2003-2005, overseeing the publishing of critical reports on health care information technology, cybersecurity, and computational sciences.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Throughout his career, Benioff has also been committed to using information technology to produce positive social change. In 2000, he launched the Salesforce.com Foundation—now a multimillion-dollar global organization—establishing the “1/1/1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of profits, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves. In 2006, Benioff authored The Business of Changing the World, in which 20 great leaders reveal how businesses can go beyond writing a check and leverage the full scope of their resources to make a difference. Compassionate Capitalism, also authored by Benioff, is the first-ever best-practices guide for corporate philanthropy that illustrates the success of the integrated model. Acknowledging his commitment to building partnerships between business and society to improve the state of the world, the members of the World Economic Forum named Benioff as one of its Young Global Leaders, and in 2007 the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the coveted Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Prior to launching salesforce.com, Benioff, a quarter century veteran of the software industry, spent 13 years at Oracle Corporation from 1986-1999. In 1984, he worked as an assembly language programmer in Apple Computer’s Macintosh Division. He founded entertainment software company Liberty Software in 1979 when he was 15 years old. Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986.</p>",
